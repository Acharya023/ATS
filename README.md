Find how resume is as required by the job description 

i tried this with two approaches:- 

ats.py has TF-IDF is useful for simple text matching based on word occurrence and frequency, but it doesn't capture the deep semantic meaning of the text.

atsnlp.py has NLP models like BERT provide a more advanced approach by capturing the contextual and semantic meaning of the text, leading to more accurate and meaningful comparisons between job descriptions and resumes.
(but in this seemingly unrelated resume are getting high score)
